# intCalc v1.0
> "The only calculator that uses integers exclusively!"

A calculator scripted in Batch to test myself.  
So far I have a nice little menu that needs some fixing and a funny motto.
  
   
   
### Special Commands:
  - Type "exit" or "e" at any prompt to exit the script.

### Future Improvements:
  - Dynamic Menu (due to user input varying in length, the menu's borders move out of place.)
  - Better Input (instead of inputting num1, op, and num2 seperately, input a whole equation.)

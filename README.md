# intCalc 1.1
> "The only calculator that uses integers exclusively!"

A calculator scripted in Batch.  
Version 1.1 brings us a nicer interface, better input, and much more compact code thanks to it.  
With better input, now all you have to do is type in the equation instead of each part individually.  

  
   
   
### Official Changelog 4 v1.1
  - Special exit commands are no longer usable. They conflict with the better input system. No idea why, honestly.
  - Customized interface. Opens window in specific size and changes background and text color to black and green.
  - Better Input! So long to typing in num1, op, and num2 individually. Now you can just type the whole equation!
  - Improved readability of code by tabbing all commands under a tag.
  - All variables wiped. Now only working with one user input variable, %_IP%, and the solution variable, %_SOL%.
  - No dynamic menu yet, but I'll try to get it worked out before putting in a pull request.  
  

#### Future Improvements:
  - Dynamic Menu (due to user input varying in length, the menu's borders move out of place.)
